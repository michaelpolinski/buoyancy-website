Scientific (and other) applications are critically dependent on calculations done using floating point arithmetic. A number of concerns have been raised about correctness in such applications given the numerous gotchas the IEEE floating point standard presents for developers, as well as the complexity of its implementation at the hardware and compiler levels. The Buoyancy Project aims to explore systems- and user-level approaches to improving the correctness and resilience of floating point calculations.
